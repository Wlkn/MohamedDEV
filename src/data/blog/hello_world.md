This is my new Website!

This next feature I am super happy with how it turned out & a HUGE credit has to go to [@phineyes](https://twitter.com/phineyes) for his work on building & hosting [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard), a service to expose your Discord presence via a RESTful API or WebSocket.

Using Lanyard I was able to build a live status widget & indicator component(s) that mean, as long as I am online on Discord, anyone is able to view what I am listening to on Spotify, what game I'm playing or even whatever I am coding thanks to a Visual Studio Code extension that adds rich presence to Discord.
